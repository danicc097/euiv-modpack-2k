It became the seat of one of the five original patriarchates, along with Constantinople, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Rome. Antioch was once a bustling metropolis of half a million souls, but declined as it was ravaged during the Byzantine-Persian wars. It fell in the 6th century as the city was razed by Khosrau I, and its entire Christian population was either deported or killed."
 HOLY_SITE_4974_DESC: "The ancient city of Jerusalem is the holiest locale in all Christendom and was the site of Jesus' crucifixion and burial. It contains the Church of the Holy Sepulchre above the cave were Jesus' body resided for three days, and was one of the five original patriarchates in early Christianity."
 HOLY_SITE_394_DESC: "Buried in the Chartreuse Mountains, Grande Chartreuse is the center of the Carthusian order, founded by Saint Bruno of Köln in the eleventh century. Due to its isolation from worldly matters and position at the fringes of Italy it is an ideal target for the expansion of the Fraticelli cause."
 HOLY_SITE_727_DESC: "Bobbio Abbey was founded in Northern Italy by Saint Colombano in 614 AD, and is thus home to spectacular ancient relics and icons in its legendary library. After distinguishing itself in the fight against the Arian heresy, by the eleventh century it had been elevated to the status of an episcopal see. This gem of learning calls out to the Franciscan cause."
 HOLY_SITE_1837_DESC: "Being the home of our founder Saint Francesco himself, Assisi was of course quickly adorned with a Franciscan Basilica which became the center of the Order. The bodies of great early Franciscan saints, combined with its strategic position strandling a hill, makes it a necessity for the Fraticellis to hold."
 HOLY_SITE_2235_DESC: "On the ancient Aventine Hill in the greatest of all cities, Rome, lies the oldest Roman Basilica in the world, Santa Sabina. The church was originally built by Pietro of Illyria in the fifth century, but today serves as the headquarters of the Dominican Order. We must win the Dominicans to our cause!"
 HOLY_SITE_4520_DESC: "Next to Saint Augustine, Benedict of Nursia is the practical founder of Western Monasticism. This prestigious theologian and Church Father founded a monastery in the south of Lazio before his death in the sixth century, Monte Cassino. Several Popes came from the abbey, its abbot was declared higher than all others, and it maintained close artistic connections with Byzantium. This abbey must be Fraticelli at all costs."
