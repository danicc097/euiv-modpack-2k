 livestock: "Cattle"
 grain: "Wheat"
 tobacco: "Inhalants"
 chinaware: "Ceramics"
 tobaccoDESC: "Inhalants encompass various recreational smoking materials such as opium and tobacco. While opium was known to the Islamic world for centuries and grown throughout Persia, tobacco was first brought from the Americas in the late 16th century. It quickly became a fashion for the upper classes who could afford it and ensured the fast and profitable economic growth of their colonies. No one knew what they put in it, but, like opium, they just couldn't stop smoking it."
 chinawareDESC: "Ceramics represents various exotic vessels such as chinaware and decorative pottery. Generally from the Orient, these high value luxuries command a high price on the market."
 livestockDESC: "Since the dawn of history, the care for domesticated animals has been one of the main occupations of humanity. Cattle includes everything from cows and oxen in rich agricultural areas to the herds of pastoralists in the great plains and deserts of the world."
 grainDESC: "Wheat represents the vegetable foodstuff that was the staple diet for humans and animals. Lack of it would always lead to revolts and riots. Other cereals and vegetable foodstuffs would later be augmented by tomatoes, corn, and even potatoes from America offering a wider choice both in food and agricultural production varieties."
 gemsDESC: "Since the earliest times, stones such as rubies, sapphires, diamonds, emeralds, jade, or amber, have been used in jewelry and ceremonial attire. For centuries the only source of diamonds in the world were the fabled mines at Golconda. While not all precious stones are as rare, they are all highly sought after commodities."
 goldDESC: "Gold was a basis for many formal currencies in Europe. The great gold mines of Central and South America would end the great bullion crisis that had gripped Europe in the previous centuries. However, unwise usage of this great wealth often led to economic ruin."
 sugarDESC: "Sugar was used not only as a sweetener but also for food preservation. The sugar cane was the only known means of obtaining sugar at this time and had been grown initially in some Mediterranean islands. In later centuries, production shifted to the New World, but the original plantations continued to operate in Europe."
 spicesDESC: "Spices were known in Europe since ancient times, mostly for their medicinal value, and for their ability to improve the taste of food. Saffron, ginger, nutmeg, chili, cinnamon, etc. came partly from East Africa but mostly from India, China, and the Spice Islands (current Indonesia), to be traded in Alexandria or the other terminals of the great caravan roads. The European desire for cheaper and more direct supply constituted the main motivation for the very first eastbound sea voyages of discoveries for Portugal."
 naval_suppliesDESC: "Naval Supplies represent everything needed in ship construction, including ropes, linen, sails, and various other materials. The Baltic was initially the main supplier until North America became an alternate source of supply in the early 18th century. Colonial expansion into America was in part to secure supplies of such vital goods."
 ironDESC: "Iron represents not just iron, but other ferrous metals and alloys. Iron formed the basis of the metallurgical industry and was used extensively in the production of weapons and other military equipment."
#New Goods 
 pepper: "Pepper"
 pepperDESC: "Peppers are grown in the Near East, and stand as one of the most popular and widespread spicy foods of the pre-modern era. While rarer spices like saffron and ginger were used to supplement other tastes, peppers could be cultivated and eaten on their own as a meal in themselves."
 barley: "Barley"
 barleyDESC: "In the first civilizations of Mesopotamia, barley was among the original grains domesticated by humans, and can be found discussed in cuneiform tablets. As a grass, it can be used to make stew and fodder, but is most famous for its use in beer."
 rye: "Rye"
 ryeDESC: "Rye is used in many of the same products as wheat and barley, such as beer, bread, fodder, and flour, but it is more resilient to poor soil. It grows in great quantities naturally in the plains of Asia Minor."
 spirits: "Spirits"
 spiritsDESC: "Spirits are a class of high-content alcohol that include beverages such as Slavic Vodka, Celtic Whiskey, or Germanic Gin. Most terms literally mean 'water of life', as the Ancient Romans referred to distilled alcohol by the name 'aqua vitae'. Though lucrative, such strong alcohol could be damaging to populations."
 oil: "Oil"
 oilDESC: "Oil represents a variety of different liquids with eclectic sources and uses. Oil could be produced from fish or vegetables, with many cities in the Orthodox world even becoming famous for the miraculous 'myron' oil that seeped from Saints' graves. Whether for pilgrims or for cooking, oil was an essential good of the medieval world."
 vegetables: "Vegetables"
 vegetablesDESC: "Vegetables are a fundamental class of foodstuffs that comprise many different types of plant-based viands including roots, tubers, certain botanical fruits, and leaves. While lettuce and carrots were grown in Europe since before the middle ages, only with the arrival of New World trade were tomatoes and potatoes transplanted to the Old World."
 dates: "Dates"
 datesDESC: "Dates were a staple food for many civilizations in the Islamic world. They had been grown in the Near East since antiquity, and their signature Date Palms were especially common in the Berber oases of Africa. Their local tastes and textures were judged by prominent chroniclers like Ibn Battuta."
 camels: "Camels"
 camelsDESC: "While Arabian horses do exist, the broad deserts and caravan trails of the Sahara and Arabia demand a more resilient animal. The camel, due to its water-storing humps, is ideal for caravan trade, and has been used in the capacity for countless generations, including by Prophet Muhammad himself."
 crabs: "Crabs"
 crabsDESC: "Before the popularization of lobsters in the modern era, crabs were the center of one of the largest fishing industries, being caught around the world with nets and traps. Though various types of crustaceans lived around Europe, the Stone Crabs of Scotland and Scandinavia were the richest in meat."
 venison: "Venison"
 venisonDESC: "Venison is the French term for the meat of deer, coming from Latin 'venare', which literally meant 'to hunt'. The etymology attests to the primacy of hunting stags in the lives of rich nobles and kings in Europe, who often lived and died with their dogs and companions out in the woods looking for deer."
 pigs: "Pigs"
 pigsDESC: "Pigs or swine are a domesticated animal kept for their meat, consumed in a variety of forms like pork, sausage, ham, bacon, and terrines. Alongside cattle, pigs form the backbone of ranching for peasant populations."
 leather: "Leather"

 pearlsDESC: "Pearls have since time immemorial been a precious substance used in jewelry and decorations. Pearls can only be obtained by diving underwater and searching through the tissue of mollusks, an industry which became prominent in the Persian Gulf."
 whales: "Whales"
 whalesDESC: "Next to fishing, whaling was one of the most prolific and lucrative oceanic industries up to the modern era. Whales were caught for their meat, insulating blubber, and even a waxy secretion called 'ambergris' which was used in perfume manufacturing. Scandinavians had whaled since the early middle ages, and it later became a major source of income for Spain and France."
 tar: "Tar"
 tarDESC: "Tar is a byproduct of the breakdown of organic materials like pine wood, coal, and peat. Since ancient times, pine tar was used to waterproof the keels of boats and to create charcoal and turpentine. Peat bogs, prominent in Northern Europe, could also help in the creation of secure roofing."
 zinc: "Zinc"
 zincDESC: "Zinc has been used since antiquity as an alloy in the creation of decorative metals like bronze. Traditionally, zinc was sourced from Calamine and Sphalerite ore, though in the early modern era scientists came to recognize Zinc as a fundemental metallic element."
 mercury: "Quicksilver"
 mercuryDESC: "Quicksilver represents Mercury and Antimony, rare metals used in medicinal ointments and cosmetics like kohl. Due to Mercury's curious property of running liquid at room temperature, many ancients imbued it with mystical powers. Until the modern era, Mercury came from only three major mines in Europe while Antimony could be found more widely in compound forms."
 minerals: "Minerals"
 mineralsDESC: "Minerals include the highly-flammable Sulphur, also known as Brimstone, and Alum, a type of aluminum salt. Unlike the standard sodium chloride used for culinary practices, Alum and Sulphur were instead used in industries like tanning, dying, alchemy, cosmetics, and pickling. Alum mines along the Black Sea coast became a major point of competition between Italian trade powers."
 beer: "Beer"
 beerDESC: "Beer was one of the most popular drinks in medieval Europe, enjoyed by both nobility and peasantry alike. The relatively simple process of cereal fermentation was gradually supplemented by such practices as Hop Flower flavoring, leading to widespread production in areas where grapes were not available."
 carpet: "Carpet"

 hemp: "Hemp"
 hempDESC: "Hemp is a type of plant fiber which has been known since antiquity to have practical applications. One of the most popular usages of hemp was in the creation of rope for naval vessels, but it could also be used for paper or textiles in general."
 lumber: "Lumber"
 lumberDESC: "Lumber is, simply put, wood which has been cut and processed into a workable state for businesses like construction or shipbuilding. The dense forests of Germany and the demand for naval power ensured lumber production was a time-tested industry throughout the Early Modern era."
 marble: "Marble"
 marbleDESC: "Marble was a favorite of the Ancients, who employed its natural beauty in the decoration of buildings and temples. When Justinian built his Hagia Sophia church in Constantinople, he ordered marble quarried from all reaches of the Empire for a breadth of style and color. In Central Europe, Italian cities like Lucca are famous for their marble."
 olive: "Olives"
 oliveDESC: "Olives grow abundantly along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. In the ancient Roman Empire, rich citizens used it to bathe and clean themselves with olive oil, though olives could often stand alone as a food item and cooking supplement for flavor and nutrition."
 rice: "Rice"
 riceDESC: "Rice is a type of cereal grain which originates in grass seeds. Rice was a staple food for much of the world's population since antiquity, and though it was much more common in Asia than Europe, there were pockets of rice-growers in medieval Italy."
 silver: "Silver"
 silverDESC: "Silver is a precious metal which has been used since Ancient Greece as a standard currency. Silver mines dotted the landscape of the Holy Roman Empire and often formed the basis for powerful local nobles. Rights to mine were granted to prospectors by the Emperor himself."
 steel: "Steel"
 steelDESC: "Steel is an iron alloy known for its relative strength. Before industrial processes from Asia were imported to Europe, steel was priced highly and used for high-quality weaponry. Damascus was famed throughout Europe for its unparalleled steel production methods and versatile blades."
 tin: "Tin"

 horses: "Horses"
 horsesDESC: "Horses play a crucial role in warfare, transportation, and farming, having been domesticated thousands of years ago. Their strength and durability makes them extremely desireable, often the most prized possession of noble and proletarian owners alike - and a tool of mass conquest for certain Asian powers."
 wax: "Wax"
 waxDESC: "Wax is a malleable material which can be derived from various natural and artificial processes. It is most famous for its use in candles, but it has a staggering range of applications from writing to polishing to metallurgy to cheesemaking. In the Middle Ages, waxes had a strict classification system based on their source."
 plumbum: "Lead"
 plumbumDESC: "Lead, or 'Plumbum' as the Romans called it, has been smelted since the earliest days of metallurgy. It is soft and corrosion-resistant like Tin, inspiring the ancients to group the two metals together, though Lead was more often used for piping. Nowadays, Lead can also be found in roofs and windows."
 munitions: "Munitions"
 munitionsDESC: "Munitions cover a range of medieval and early-modern materials, such as gunpowder, cannons, high explosives, or basic smithed weaponry. Though important to any military, the task of safely securing munitions is difficult - in 1687 a tragic gunpowder accident would destroy Athens' great Parthenon, leaving it in ruins for centuries."
 corn: "Corn"
 cornDESC: "Corn was originally known as 'Maize' to the Spanish who encountered mass cultivation of the crop by indigenous Central Americans. Despite trepidations, they quickly brought the crop back to Europe where it was used as food and animal feed."
