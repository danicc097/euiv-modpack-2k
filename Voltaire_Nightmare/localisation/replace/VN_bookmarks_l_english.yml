 THE_GREAT_SCHISM: "The Great Schism"
 THE_GREAT_SCHISM_DESC: "The 'Great' or 'East-West' schism was a gradual alienation between the Byzantine church and the Western rite loyal to the Papacy. While it entailed centuries of cultural and doctrinal divergences such as the Filioque controversy, July 16th 1054 marked the unprecedented mutual excommunication of Papal legates and Patriarch Kiroularios. Though the incident was soon rectified, a division in Christianity was becoming increasingly undeniable. \nOverseas, virtually the entire Middle East had come under the control of Shia dynasties, but a surging movement of Turkish Sunni warriors, calling themselves 'Ghazi', was consolidating its power under the leadership of the Seljuk clan. With the radical Almoravids similarly poised to attack the Kharijites in Africa, the established order could be quickly undone..."

 THE_FIRST_CRUSADE: "The First Crusade"
 THE_FIRST_CRUSADE_DESC: "After the failed mass-movement of Peter the Hermit, a well-disciplined alliance of French Princes brought their retinues down to Anatolia and scored a string of successes against the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, virtually collapsing its authority. With the Levantine coast in chaos due to Islamic infighting, the 'Crusaders', under their de-facto leader Godfrey of Bouillon, now set their sight on recapturing the most holy city in Christendom - Jerusalem."

 BATTLE_OF_HATTIN: "The Battle of Hattin"
 BATTLE_OF_HATTIN_DESC: "The disastrous Battle of Hattin saw Saladin's forces route a grand Crusader army in reaction to hostilities from Raynald of Châtillon. Raynald was executed, King Guy of Jerusalem was captured, and Jerusalem's flanks now lay open for total Egyptian conquest. \n \nNews of the loss would spread fast, however, and within a few months two of the greatest monarchs of Europe would start planning another Crusade to defeat Saladin and liberate the Holy Kingdom's lost lands..."

 LATIN_EMPIRE_START: "The Latin Empire"
 LATIN_EMPIRE_START_DESC: "The notorious and ill-fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV who sought to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so-called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. \n \nMeanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty."

 DEATH_OF_CONRAD: "The Battle of Parma"
 DEATH_OF_CONRAD_DESC: "On the 18th of February 1248 the Guelph forces of the Lombard League attacked the Ghibelline camp outside Parma while Emperor Friedrich II was off hunting, routing his army completely and capturing the Crown Jewels. Though Friedrich began to amass a new army in Southern Italy, the defeat inspired many more Italian states to take up arms against him, cementing the decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. \n \nIn the east, the more successful emperor Ioannes Batatzes of Nikaia is poised to deliver more crippling blows to Bulgaria and eventually retake the holy Byzantine capital."

 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY: "Babylonian Captivity"
 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY_DESC: "March 1309 marked the movement of the Curia under Pope Clemens V to Avignon, where subsequent Popes would reside for 67 years. The Papal proximity to the Kingdom of France allowed Philippe IV and his successors to exert considerable influence over Catholic affairs, leading the period to be labelled the 'Babylonian Captivity' after an ancient Biblical story. \n \nHeinrich VII had recently secured the Royal German election and would soon be crowned Holy Roman Emperor after decades of Interregnum, establishing the House of Luxemburg as a powerful Imperial dynasty."

 HYW_START: "Hundred Years War"
 HYW_START_DESC: "The death of French King Charles IV in 1328 with no immediate heir triggered a succession dispute that would last for over a hundred years. Edward III of England was the closest living male heir, but the French nobility, balking at the prospect of a foreign king, claimed the line could not pass through a woman, and crowned another pretender - Philippe. Nine years later, war broke out..."

 THE_GOLDEN_BULL: "The Golden Bull"
 THE_GOLDEN_BULL_DESC: "At the Diet of Metz, one of the most important decrees in the history of the Holy Roman Empire was issued by Emperor Karl IV. The so-called Golden Bull firmly established the Empire's electoral system by elevating seven princes to theoretically permanent privileges: Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, and the Palatinate."

 IN_NOMINE_START_DESC: "The year is 1399 and there is turmoil everywhere. The Hundred Years War rages on in France, while the Byzantine Empire clings to just a few enclaves across thousands of miles of Islamic land. However, amongst all the chaos, scholars in Italy have effected a reinvigoration of ancient knowledge which may develop into a full-fledged paradigm shift in Western thought. Glory is there for those who can seize the opportunity..."

 string_start_region_iberia_1054: "While the Great Schism looks to be severing the eastern and western Churches, a struggle of a different character is being fought on the arid plains and mountains of Iberia.\n\nEver since the Islamic §YUmayyad§! conquest of Iberia in the 8th century the Christian inhabitants in the north have fought back and defied attempts to subjugate them, gradually eroding the Caliphate's grip on the continent. But despite the efforts of the Reconquista, only five decades ago the Caliphate of §YCórdoba§!, the unquestioned rulers of §YAl-Andalus§!, was united and prosperous. Córdoba itself could be called the largest city in all of Europe and was a beacon of the Islamic world as well as a melting pot of religions and cultures.\n\nBut the cracks began to appear as a ruinous civil war engulfed the caliphate starting in 1009 between feuding brothers, a power struggle from which it would never recover. The once mighty caliphate is now a shadow of its former self in 1054, reduced to a republican state with the rest divided among competing taifas. But there may yet be hope for the ambitions of caliphs in centuries past to be fulfilled; it is only the question of who will seize the opportunity and if they can survive the looming threat to the north.\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia are numerous but committed to the cause of liberating the south. The kingdom of §YLeón§!, the most prominent, has recently united §YGalicia§! and §YCastile§! under the rule of its king §YFernando I§!, posing a significant threat to the bordering taifas. As a result of constant warfare the borderlands have become a depopulated no man's land, though the hotly contested border in the west is checked by the march of §YPortucale§!. Even gold is playing an increasingly important role as the north uses its influence to demand payments (parias) from the weaker taifas.\n\nIn the east the kingdom of §YNavarra§! is in a precarious situation. Disagreements with their Leónese neighbors may prove problematic in the near future as the kingdom struggles to reverse its ongoing decline. And the kingdom of §YAragon§!, though small, may become a powerful player on the continent if it can acquire a stake in the Reconquista. The county of §YBarcelona§!, along with the other polities of §YCatalonia§!, are now independent from the French crown in all but name as the task is left to them to drive out the Islamic presence from the region."
 string_start_title_france_1054: "1054 Overview: France"
 string_start_region_france_1054: "High Middle Ages §YFrance§!: a prosperous, united kingdom with unrivalled power and influence, the cradle of Western Europe. Or so it would seem on an ordinary map.\n\nThe reality of France in 1054 is one of fragmentation and division, far from the glory days of §YCharlemagne§!'s empire in the 9th century. Though the §YCapet§! dynasty based in §YParis§! claims de jure authority over the whole of the kingdom, the fiefs of the realm are often distanced from affairs in the capital and their loyalties are largely symbolic. Many powerful vassals such as §YNormandy§!, §YChampagne§! and §YToulouse§! act more or less independently of the king, facilitated by cultural and linguistic divides. Some such as the duke of §YBrittany§! and the count of §YBarcelona§! are merely vassals in name and refuse to respect the king's authority.\n\nBut all across the realm, signs of change are on the horizon. Brittany is beset by a fierce dynastic conflict, one that could determine the nation's course. Meanwhile, the Norman duke §YGuillaume II§! consolidates his power, having thwarted recent French and §YAngevin§! invasions; now being an unlikely candidate for the §YEnglish§! throne, he schemes to seize it whether through peaceful or hostile means, but not without opposition from the English themselves and rival claimants as far afield as §YNorway§!. Furthermore, large duchies that were once dominant, such as §YAquitaine§!, have begun to fracture into smaller states as lesser lords carve out local lands for themselves.\n\nThe winds of change are also reverberating throughout society. Communes have begun to develop in the already expanding and prospering market towns, and fundamental changes in the principles of feudalism are reshaping the political landscape. In the absence of strong central authority, powerful magnates are rapidly rising to prominence, many of which may in the future seek glory outside the kingdom's borders. But for now, it remains to be seen who will take advantage of these developments.\n\nDespite the significant challenges facing the French king §YHenri I§! from all sides, a succession of strong monarchs may yet be able to extend their royal demesne outside Paris and bring the defiant vassals to heel. But to ultimately succeed they must manoeuver between external dangers, the most pressing being the §YHoly Roman Empire§! to the east, while also curtailing the power of the lords within their borders. Diplomacy, war and the complexities of feudalism must all play to their advantage in this struggle; France’s fate lies in their hands..."
 string_start_title_britain_1054: "1054 Overview: British Isles"
 string_start_region_britain_1054: "The mysterious isles up north, though relatively isolated from events on the mainland, have nonetheless been thrust into strife and uncertainty over their future.\n\nIn 1054 the Anglo-Saxon kingdom is finally prospering again under their king §YEadweard the Confessor§!. With a strong economy through exports of wool to the continent, §YÆngland§! is one of the wealthiest states in Europe. However, the legacy of the §YViking§! invasion of England just four decades before is still fresh in memory. The §YDanish§! king §YCnut§! successfully subjugated the kingdom in 1015 in his quest to forge a North Sea empire, but his successors were unable to hold onto it after 1042. Regardless, those of Danish descent now constitute a majority of the population in the northern §YDanelaw§!, a region unwilling to abide by laws imposed from the south.\n\nBut Eadweard himself is aging and has still not yet produced an heir to succeed him as rival claimants, particularly Earl §YHereweald§! of §YWessex§! and King §YHarald§! of §YNorway§!, prepare to make the first move for the throne. Additionally there are even rumours that Eadweard has promised the throne to Duke §YGuillaume I§! of §YNormandy§! should he die without issue, which if true could alter the course of English history. Meanwhile, further north the Anglo-Danish Earl §YSiward§! of §YNorthumbria§! has taken up arms against the kingdom of §YAlba§! to depose the tyrant king §YMacbeth§! once and for all.\n\nElsewhere, the §YWelsh§! princes have thus far been able to distance themselves from affairs in London, but should the ambivalent English relations with them worsen their subjugation may be all but inevitable. However, the efforts of the ambitious §YGruffydd ap Llywelyn§! of §YGwynedd§! and §YPowys§! to unite Wales under one banner may reverse their fortunes and perhaps allow them to drive back the Germanic yoke.\n\nIn §YIreland§! the era of High Kings claiming supremacy over the entire island looks to be over with the death of the last unanimously acknowledged High King, §YBrian Boru§!, at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. In the aftermath, Ireland has remained divided among regional dynasties albeit with the influence of the Norse invaders, by now reduced to a few small holdings on the coast, permanently broken as a result of the battle. Only time will tell whether the decades-long interregnum will finally come to an end and who among the patchwork of feuding clans will triumph."
 string_start_title_scandinavia_1054: "1054 Overview: Scandinavia"
 string_start_region_scandinavia_1054: "In 1054, Scandinavia is at a crossroads: while the Viking Age is in decline as paganism and the culture of raiding and seafaring are gradually phased out, the influence of old Norse ways is still tangible.\n\nEver since the century prior, Roman Catholicism has slowly but surely taken root in many of the kingdoms that once revered Odin, Thor and Freya. First came §YDenmark§!, whose ruler §YHarald Bluetooth§! converted to Christianity in the late 10th century, and then the efforts of §YOlaf Tryggvason§! in §YNorway§! who led an aggressive campaign of converting the country. However, in §YSweden§! these same efforts have had a mixed legacy as a significant part of the country still clings on to its old beliefs, and it is unclear whether the kingdom will join its neighbors or firmly follow its own path.\n\nIn Norway, under §YHarald 'Hardråde'§! the realm is finally at peace after clashes with Denmark have died down. These conflicts led to a disastrous defeat at the naval battle of Svolder in 1000 and the Danish king §YSvend Forkbeard§! becoming king of Norway. A Christian Norwegian, §YOlaf Haraldsson§!, managed to regain the throne but was killed at the battle of Stiklestad in 1030; Norway then became part of the Dane §YCnut the Great§!'s domain until 1035. But this peace may not last long as tensions over who will succeed King §YEadweard§! of §YÆngland§! reaches breaking point and Harald, determined to press his dubious claim to the throne, waits to make his move.\n\nSweden under the reign of §YEmund the Old§! will have to contend with its deep religious divisions amid an ongoing dispute with the Archbishopric of §YBremen§!, while also ensuring that a king does not rule both Norway and Denmark for fear of being surrounded. With the unification of both the Swedes and the §YGeats§! under one realm, however, they may be poised to challenge their neighbors in the future. They are also well placed to expand east across the Baltic as the western trade routes become less lucrative.\n\nIn the meantime, Denmark has only recently split from a short period of Norwegian rule after the sudden death of §YMagnus the Good§! in 1047. Now under §YSvend II§!, Denmark must decide whether to restore its former dominance in Scandinavia and England or protect itself from outside threats. Meanwhile, the last §YNorse-Gaelic§! holdouts in the British Isles must contend with the decline of the Viking Age and establish closer links to the islands lest they be driven out entirely."
 string_start_title_westslavic_1054: "1054 Overview: West Slavic Region"
 string_start_region_westslavic_1054: "Facing threats from all sides, the Western Slavs are in a precarious position, exacerbated by the severing of the Eastern Orthodox Church that has weakened the bonds with their Slavic brethren in the east.\n\nThe dominant power in the region is the duchy of §YPoland§!, ruled by the §YPiasts§! who also reign in §YSilesia§! and §YMazovia§!, but this is by no means an uncontested position. From the death of King §YBoleslaw I 'the Brave'§! in 1025 until recently, the nation was thrust into strife, rebellions and invasions by §YBohemia§! and the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. The conquests achieved by Boleslaw in §YLusatia§!, §YPomerania§!, §YRed Ruthenia§! and §YSlovakia§! were all undone under §YMieszko II 'Lambert'§!. To make matters worse, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the Christianization of Poland, culminating in a pagan revolt during the 1030s that swept the country.\n\nNo one was effectively ruling Poland when in 1039, the Duke §YBretislav§! of Bohemia launched an invasion of Greater Poland that crippled the heart of the Polish state. The former capital, Gniezno, was pillaged and destroyed, consequently causing the capital to be relocated to Krakow. But from the ashes rose §YKazimierz I 'the Restorer'§!, who in 1040 ascended the throne, by now a mere duke of Poland. He reunited the country, expelled the invaders and kept Silesia and Mazovia in Polish hands. As a result, Poland's situation is now more stable, but its prestige and power have been greatly diminished.\n\nConversely to the Polish situation, the §YPomeranians§! are enjoying independence once again after a successful uprising in 1005. Compounded by the destruction of the Norse §YJomsvikings§!' seat of power on the River Oder in 1043, the region is free of foreign influences and is a bastion of paganism, at least for now. With the Poles and Germans seeking to re-establish a foothold on the Baltic coast, however, a clash over the region seems almost inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, the western precipice of Slav lands is divided into many tribal states still adhering to pagan ways. Their most pressing threat will likely be any incursion made by the Holy Roman Empire, determined to recover the territory held by the §YBillung§! and §YNorthern Marches§! that were lost in the Great Slav Rising of 983. The Slavs now must present a real challenge to Germanic expansion, or risk being consigned to footnotes in history..."

 string_start_region_baltic_1054: "Of all the regions of Europe in 1054, the §YBaltic§! region is perhaps the most mysterious, detached as they are from the rest of Christian Europe, yet is teeming with conflicts waiting to spill over.\n\nIn the west, the region of §YPruthenia§! is home to the §YOld Prussian§! tribes following the §YDruwi§! faith. The tribes, in particular the §YSemba§!, have long-established trading links with the rest of Europe through the Amber Road. However, this trade was recently dealt a blow when in 1016 the prosperous market town of Kaup was burned to the ground during a §YDanish§! raid. Also, in the late 10th century the §YPoles§! intermittently launched raids into the region. Though menacing, the threat presented by Christian powers seems to have subsided for now, although the status quo still hangs in the balance.\n\nFurther north, the §YDievturi§! and §YMaausko§! coexist along the main artery of trade in the region, the Daugava river, through which trade from §YScandinavia§! to the rich city of Constantinople passes. Amid this highly competitive environment, many separate cultures have emerged. These include the §YLivs§! and §YEstonians§! as well as the §YLatgalians§!, on the fringe of the §YKievan Rus'§! territory and influenced by the neighboring principality of §YPolotsk§!, and the §YCuronians§!, who maintain a mostly seafaring raiding lifestyle, earning them the nickname 'Baltic Vikings'.\n\nTo the south, the adherents of the §YRomuva§! faith also form various tribes. Though united in faith, the highlands and lowlands of §YLithuania§! have forged two distinct cultures over time, the §YSamogitians§! and §YAukstaitians§!. However, time will tell if they can overcome their tribal divisions and break the Slavic yoke. Meanwhile, beyond the Gulf of Finland, the §YSuomenusko§! §YFinns§!, §YKarelians§! and §YIngrians§! are relatively isolated, but there are signs of major changes on the horizon as Scandinavia begins to look east to spread their new Christian faith.\n\nWherever our state may be or whichever faith our people follow, there can be no doubt that the mosaic of tribes as they are now will not last forever - only one will prevail in the end."

Divided into hundreds of autonomous counties and duchies, the Emperor, King of §YGermany§!, §YBurgundy§! and §YItaly§!, rules over many different peoples of the continent.\n\nAfter the extinction of the §YLiudolfingers§! in 1024, Count §YConrad II§! of §YWorms§! was elected Emperor, member of the §YSalier§! dynasty, which has ruled the Empire ever since. Through the promotion of imperial secular and ecclesiastical institutions, such as the construction of the Cathedral of §YSpeyer§!, hitherto the largest existing cathedral, the Emperor's political position was greatly solidified and expanded. Although many princes dislike the Emperor's growing power, clever moves on the board of power have made it possible to avoid major conspiracies and rebellions so far...\n\nThe Duchy of §YSaxony§!, located in the north of Germany, which is ruled by the house of §YBillung§!, has frequently opposed the Emperors in the past, who might revolt again under a weak Emperor, trying to influence the surrounding counties. But also in the south, the Duchies of §YSwabia§! and §YBavaria§! play an important role in the imperial politics, whereby the latter is currently experiencing a phase of instability, after the former Duke §YConrad I von Welf§! was deposed by Emperor §YHenry III§! because of his disloyalty. Swabia's dukes, however, have always appeared as loyal allies of the Emperor, receiving several counties and cities as imperial donations. The Duchy of §YBohemia§!, the only §YSlavic§! territory in the Empire, has been weakened in recent years by conflicts with the §YPolish§! Crown and the Emperor but could turn out to be a dangerous enemy for them if the Duke is able to consolidate his domain.\n\nThe Empire borders on Slavic tribal territory in the north, which is ruled by heathen tribesmen. The subjugation of this region has turned out to be difficult in the past, as its inhabitants have persistently defended themselves against their conquerors, thus repulsing them again. The counts and dukes close to the border will still attempt to subjugate the tribes permanently in order to obtain new land for settlement. However, not only the Holy Roman Emperor has cast an eye on these areas, but also the Kings of §YDenmark§! and Poland.\n\nTechnically, all Imperial Princes have the potential to become the next Emperor, but only time will tell which dynasty will obtain the approval of the Electors and be able to kick the Salians off the Imperial Throne in the end."

The Margraviate of §YTuscany§! is formed around the most fertile region of Italy, with the wealthy capital of §YFlorence§!, providing its rulers with lavish treasuries.

Thanks to the Emperor's help, the Papacy was liberated from the grips of Roman aristocracy in 1046, which allowed the Popes to initiate reforms of the Catholic Church, gradually strengthening the Pope's position. Pope §YVictor II§! and his successors will certainly not deviate from this course, trying to make the Papacy the most influential authority in the Catholic World...\n\nIn southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire is attempting to defend its last possessions against an alliance of §YLombards§! and §YNormans§! for years now, who were originally hired as mercenaries as support against Saracen pirates. Claiming a considerable territory already due to their past victories, the Normans were able to defeat Papal troops in the recent Battle of Civitate in 1053, followed by the acknowledgment of Duke §YHumphrey de Hauteville§! as 'Duke of §YApulia§! and §YCalabria§!' by the Pope. After the Greeks have been expelled from Italy altogether, the Normans will certainly try to expand their territory even further.\n\nBecause of their wealth, the islands of §YCorsica§! and §YSardinia§! are frequently targeted by Saracen pirates, but over time they have learned to defend themselves against them. However, due to their central location in the Mediterranean Sea, they might serve as potential trading colonies for the trade republics of Pisa, Genoa and §YAmalfi§!.

In the following century, the Rus' experienced its Golden Age. Under Oleg of Kiev, a successful campaign against the §YByzantine Empire§! led to a dictatorial peace, resulting in numerous trade privileges beneficial to the Rus'. Consequently, trade with Byzantium flourished, leading to the Rus's conversion to Orthodox Christianity in 988. This allowed the Rurikids to forge links with all of Europe, becoming one of the most respected noble families ever since.\n\nThe Kievan Rus' itself is not a hereditary monarchy, but relies on the §YRota§! system, a seniority principle in which the oldest of the Rurikids usually inherits the title of the Grand Prince. Therefore, it will certainly not make it easy to end the ongoing feuds within the Rus', let alone to centralize the realm in the future. This might entangle the entire Rus' in a civil war, making it vulnerable to invasion from the East..."

 string_start_region_steppes_1054: "Despite its small population, the §YEurasian Steppe§! is considered the birthplace of many European nations and yet it is also the cemetery of former empires.\n\nThe dominant power in the steppes is the loose §YCuman-Kipchak§! tribal confederation, which defeated the native §YPechenegs§! and confiscated their territories in 1054, originally coming from the eastern steppes. The latter were pushed into the territory of the §YKievan Rus'§! and confiscated the western bank of the §YDniester§! River. The mounted archers of the Pechenegs have posed a great danger to the Rus' in the past, whose borders were frequently invaded by the steppe peoples. Time will tell whether these horsemen will remain the enemies of the Russians, or whether they will ally against their mutual enemies.\n\nThe cities of the §YBlack Sea§! coast represent an important connection for trade with §YConstantinople§! and the Mediterranean Sea. Many of these cities belong to the ruler of §YTmutarakan§!, who himself is vassal of the Grand Prince of Kiev. Certainly, the Cumans will try to get their hands on all the riches stored in these cities, and it is doubtful whether Kievan Rus will be able to defend these exclaves in the long run.\n\nThe northern Caucasian mountains are inhabited by countless clans and tribes, all of which belong to different cultures and religions, having all been able to shake off §YByzantine§! missionary attempts. In the east live the last remnants of the §YHunnic§!, §YKhazarian§! and §YAvarian§! empires, whose khans were powerful men in past centuries who ruled over large parts of Eastern Europe. Further west §YAlania§! represents the local power, which itself is only a confederation of different tribes though. On their eastern border live the §YCircassians§!, whose clans are divided, but could be forced to cooperate against foreign invaders if necessary.\n\nThe cold north is the home of primitive §YUgric§! tribes, which, accustomed to the harsh climate, have always yielded to their traditional customs unaffected by foreign influences. The estuary of the Volga and Kama rivers is ruled by the descendants of §YKubral Dulo§!, the founder of the Great Bulgarian Empire in the 7th century - hence their name '§YVolga Bulgaria§!'. Despite their simple society, they remain a major trading power thanks to their location, which allows them to maintain friendly relations with their neighbors."

The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan’s authority.\n\nAll this is about to change. Having defeated the Crusader armies, the old sultan Murad II is now on his way back to his estates in Manisa, leaving the government in the hands of the young §YMehmed II§!.
