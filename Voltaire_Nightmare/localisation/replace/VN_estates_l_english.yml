 holy_orders_estate_events.1.a: "Okay."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.t: "Knightly Training Proves Successful"
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.d: "It has been a while now since we sent [Root.Heir.GetName] to the members of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ to educate [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in their abilities. In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion. We should sincerely thank the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ for taking care of the training of our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] so diligently and making [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] an exemplary knight."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.a: "Reward them generously"

 holy_orders_estate_events.3.d: "Not only the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ takes over the administration of our provinces, but also the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] excel by their modern methods. They particularly insist on preserving newly conquered territory so that they can take special care of the conversion of heretics and heathens.

 holy_orders_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have gained considerable influence at the [Root.GetAdjective] court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in the past years, often providing advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and dominating state affairs today. Even the Holy Father himself has heard of this and has thus passed a decree granting a special position to the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$, freeing them from [Root.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and placing them directly under the authority of the Catholic Church. This means a massive intervention in our internal politics!"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.a: "All right, then"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.b: "We can't let that happen"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.t: "Noble Knights"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.d: "A serious dispute has broken out between the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName]. An influential knight, who is an excellent fighter not only in jousting, insists on being elevated to the rank of baron by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], as he, being a bastard, has no inheritance rights. While the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ support him in this - hoping for political advantages by doing so - the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ vigorously rejects this, as they fear for their own power. Whose side do we take?"

 holy_orders_estate_events.5.b: "We appreciate the concerns of our high nobility"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.t: "Uncertain Pilgrimage to Jerusalem"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.d: "A large group of [Root.GetAdjective] pilgrims wants to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the Holiest City of Christianity. But the route to get there is many hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers long, often leading through rough terrain. To make matters worse, the pilgrims will probably have to cross lands where Christians are unwanted, possibly even persecuted. The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] however, offer to accompany the travellers to Jerusalem and protect them with their swords from potential danger."

 holy_orders_estate_events.7.d: "The relations between our court and the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have become worse than ever. Quite blatantly, they are expressing their aversion to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and denying their loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. This is an outrageous affront to the feudal liabilities of [Root.GetName] and massively undermines our authority in the [Root.GetAdjective] bailiwicks. How can we defuse this situation?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.a: "Show them who's in charge"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.b: "We mustn't aggravate the situation"

Therefore, the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ want to get permission from us to expand the existing hospice with a new infirmary in order to be able to continue fulfilling their charitable obligations."

 holy_orders_estate_events.9.d: "Many of the knights of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have acquired renown beyond our borders through the past battles against our religious enemies they fought. In many places, the courage and bravery of our knights are appreciated, whose chivalrousness is also exceptional and outstanding. Verily, they reflect our entire nation's attachment to Christianity, making us all humble Christians."

 holy_orders_estate_events.10.d: "In recent years, the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] have produced many great soldiers, advisors and administrators.

 holy_orders_estate_events.11.d: "These days, the future of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ in [Root.GetName] is uncertain, as their duties are mostly already entrusted to the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy or nobility. Their political influence has shrunk to the confines of their few hospices or bailiwicks, meaning that they enjoy almost no importance at our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."

 mamluks_estate_events.4.t: "Conflict Between $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.1: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Turkish and Circassian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. A Turkish commander and a Circassian accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.2: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Franji (European) and African $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An African commander and a European accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.3: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Saqaliba (Slavic) and native Iberian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An Iberian commander and a Slavic accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.a: "Side with the commander"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.b: "Side with the accountant"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.t: "Abuse of the Dhimmi"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.d: "Just as the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are comprised of ethnic minorities, the religious minorities form an important part of our realm in their status as Dhimmi. They pay the jizya tax loyally and expect protection and tolerance in turn from the government. We have received complaints, however, that certain $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ began jeering at a group of infidel practitioners and ended up assaulting them in an all-out brawl. The Dhimmi collectively demand we address this outrage and punish the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ responsible."
 mamluks_estate_events.5.a: "Jail them"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.b: "Execute them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.c: "Who cares?"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.t: "Halqa and $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.d: "The core of our military structure is the division between slave-soldiers and freeborn professional soldiers, known in Arabic as al-Halqa. In one of our recent campaigns, a group of experienced $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ suggested that we would be strategically better off with them having command precedence over their Halqa counterparts. There may be truth to this claim, but at the same time agreeing to the proposal would perhaps be granting the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ a dangerous amount of power."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.a: "We can keep them in line..."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.b: "Preserve the status quo"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.t: "Conspiracy Thwarted"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.d: "Succession in a Mamluk Sultanate is a complex and ambiguous issue. As such, different factions of [Root.GetMamluksName] frequently plotted against and assassinated reigning monarchs to install themselves into power. It was through this very method that the [Root.GetMamluksName] took over from their erstwhile lords in the first place. Word of just such a conspiracy has come to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], apparently headed by one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] old rivals.\nWhat should be done about this insolence?"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.a: "Execute the ringleaders"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.b: "Bribe them"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.t: "Unrest in the Barracks"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.d: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are usually sold to [Root.GetAdjective] traders at a young age, and from then on they are raised in barracks in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be trained in the most advanced military arts. In theory their foreign origin keeps them disinterested in domestic power struggles, but in practice the opposite is often true. Apparently a contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has been causing trouble over food quality in the barracks and compelling their brethren toward disloyalty as well."
 mamluks_estate_events.8.a: "There is little we can do"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.t: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ Conspire With Foreign Power"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.d: "Despite all their privileges, the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ never cease to feel resentment at their status. Throughout history there have been attempts to overthrow extant powers and establish new independent dynasties ruled by the descendants of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$. To this end, a certain cadre of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has gone behind our back to work with one of our sworn enemies. These scoundrels have supplied the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ with weapons for an insurrection against the state, which is set to launch immediately."
 mamluks_estate_events.9.a: "Curse them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.t: "A Grand Tournament"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.d: "The prestige of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ was tied to their patron and vice versa. $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ frequently would entertain themselves with sporting games involving martial prowess in addition to their weekly Furusiyya cavalry drills. The court has been asked to fund a grand demonstration that will show off $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ from the households of noblemen around the realm, though funding the usual Furusiyya shows already drains the state's coffers considerably."
 mamluks_estate_events.10.a: "Pay for the games"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.b: "We need the money"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.t: "Incorporation of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.d: "Our recent military victories have led us to a quandary - what should be done with the hostile contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ that is now at our mercy? If we incorporate them into our own ranks we can expect their loyalty, but at the same time, continual combination of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ into larger and larger groups could end up threatening the power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mamluks_estate_events.11.a: "Welcome them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.b: "Disband them"
 monopoly_privileges.11.d: "The monopoly on slaves we granted to the [Root.GetMamluksName] has expired, meaning that we are now able to reclaim the income from slave trading. However, the [Root.GetMamluksName] are keen to keep their privileges and are offering to pay us a lump sum in return for the monopoly being guaranteed for a further 10 years."

Herbads openly condemn [Root.Monarch.GetName] during ceremonies and Asronan families refuse to cooperate in the rule of our Zoroastrian subjects. A recent religious faux-pas on the part of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has tipped mere outrage into outright rebellion. The Asronan have incited the people to rise against our rule!"
 brahmins_estate_events.7.t: "Asronan Alienating Merchants in [brahmin_trade_province.GetName]"
 brahmins_estate_events.7.d: "The city of [brahmin_trade_province.GetCapitalName] is an important regional trade hub for [Root.Country.GetName]. It is visited often by Muslim traders from Anatolia, Arabia, and Persia, and [brahmin_trade_province.GetName] has profited from strong commercial connections with these merchants.\n\n[brahmin_trade_province.GetName] has come to be administered by a group of Mobad clerics whose influence has been felt at every level of society. They have enacted a series of policies and created a social atmosphere that is far from friendly from the perspective of visiting Muslim traders. As a result, many of these alienated traders have decided to take their business elsewhere. [brahmin_trade_province.GetName] at risk of losing its status as a trade hub if something is not done to attract commerce back to the city."

 brahmins_estate_events.8.d: "One Mobad has proven a highly capable administrator and has gained the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While Asronan have long been entrenched into [Root.Country.GetName]’s bureaucracy, it is rare for Asronan to have an explicitly political role even in the courts of Zoroastrian nations.\nThe appointment of this Mobad as Wuzurg Framadar, the highest appointed ministerial office, is an appealing prospect. Though the Asronan of [Root.Country.GetName] would take the opportunity to increase their influence, it would assure our Zoroastrian subjects that we have their best interests at heart."

 brahmins_estate_events.9.d: "The Asronan have traditionally had a monopoly on Zoroastrian religious authority, but occasionally religious movements emerge that challenge Zoroastrianism. Such movements are becoming popular throughout [Root.Country.GetName] in spite of Asronan efforts to suppress them. Exponents of popular religion argue that the Asronan have eschewed their spiritual responsibilities in order to occupy seats of temporal power and mete out injustice to the poor. They declare that selfless devotion is the only path to salvation, a virtue that can be attained by any sufficiently fervent Zoroastrian.\n\nA group of influential Mobads have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] pleading for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] aid in restoring public confidence in Asronan authority and suppressing non-Zoroastrian movements."

The fort of [brahmin_fort_province.GetName], currently held by a particularly contentious general, lies in a province where the Asronan are gaining influence of their own.\n\nForeseeing the potential for tensions to break out into hostilities, it may be wise to transfer control of this important fort from the contentious general to the Asronan.

 vaisyas_estate_events.2.d: "A host of social and economic problems in [Root.Country.GetName] have led to an eruption of highway banditry throughout the realm. Banditry has become so prolific that some cities have not received a single trade caravan in months.\n\nSeveral bandit leaders are seen as folk heroes by the local populace, bravely resisting the rule of the parasitic state of [Root.Country.GetName], founding new frontier towns, and recruiting local labor. Drawing into their ranks Zoroastrians and Muslims, toddy-tappers and smiths, the bandits have attracted widespread support.\n\nA direct military confrontation with the bandits would solve the immediate problem if we could root them out from their makeshift forts. However, the problem is only likely to resurface if we do not address the social and economic factors that make the bandits powerful and popular."

 vaisyas_estate_events.3.d: "The Hutukhshan occupy a privileged and favored position in [Root.Country.GetName]. As the backbone of our economy, the Hutukhshan expertise in all matters mercantile and industrious are a great boon to our nation. Thanks to our patronage and their rising fortune, the Hutukhshan have expanded local industry in [thriving_vaisyas_province.GetName]."
 vaisyas_estate_events.4.d: "The textile industry of the Middle East is unrivaled. Vast plantations grow silk and cotton, feeding mighty manufactories that produce countless millions of yards of textile cloth. Planters, weavers, dyers, merchants and even noble princes create an intricate and organized network of labor, production, and trade. Such a thriving commercial market is naturally an ideal breeding ground for innovation. Through our wise delegation of the industry to the Hutukhshan, [Root.Country.GetName] finds itself at the forefront of new developments in textile production."

With the Asronan taking center stage for ceremonies, their status as leaders of the spiritual hierarchy is made clear to all in attendance. The Arteshtaran, warriors and princes, make their own displays of power and status.\n\nOften overlooked are the Hutukhshan, our traders and craftsmen. Seeking to advance their station, the representatives of the Hutukhshan guilds have requested that sufficiently esteemed members of their members be allowed the right to ride palanquins and blow conch shells during certain ceremonies.

 vaisyas_estate_events.8.d: "[Root.Country.GetName] has become renowned for its trade in high value commodities such as spices, precious gemstones, and fine silks. Merchants come from far off lands to purchase goods that we produce in abundance, but which to them are exotic luxuries.\n\nThe key to our success in these industries has been our patronage of various guilds who draw their membership from the Hutukhshan. Our investments have thus far proven profitable, and it stands to reason that further investment will only continue to yield greater riches. We should determine which of our luxury goods industries is most important to [Root.Country.GetName] and focus our efforts on the advancement of the guilds involved."

 vaisyas_estate_events.9.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has granted many privileges and concessions to the Hutukhshan merchant guilds. Wielding almost unchecked power over the nation’s economy, they have become a force to be reckoned with in [Root.GetAdjective] politics.\n\nSensing an opportunity to accumulate even greater power, the most powerful of these guilds have sent an embassy to [Root.Capital.GetName] with a series of polite but emphatic policy recommendations. Our financial advisors see some commercial merit to these policies, but note that they entail granting an outrageous degree of autonomy to the provinces where the guilds are most powerful, essentially making them into merchant-princes. Refusing these demands would anger the guilds greatly, though it would go a long way towards curtailing their power."
 vaisyas_estate_events.10.d: "The Middle East is a dry and rugged land, requiring regular investment in its frontier settlements to be profitable to the state. Decades of neglect and a series of unexpected droughts in [drylands_province.GetName] have led to poor harvests, a steady decline in land revenue, and a trend towards migration away from the drylands and towards the wealthy cities of the coast.\n\nThe situation in [drylands_province.GetName] could however be reversed through the construction of canals and water tanks, ensuring enough water to allow the population to grow and for agriculture to expand. While this would end the stagnation in [drylands_province.GetName], it would draw our focus away from our coastal trading settlements. We must consider which is more valuable to us at the present time."
 vaisyas_estate_events.11.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] society is increasingly becoming more concerned with trade, industry, and profit than on martial endeavors. Many nobles, especially from the ranks of the Azadan nobility, are concerned that our nation is becoming soft and ill-prepared for war as Princes prefer to devote themselves to commerce rather than military studies. Representatives of the Hutukhshan argue not only that war is bad for business, but that a nation without full coffers cannot wage war effectively. We must decide whether to promote a mercantile or a martial society."

 rajputs_estate_events.2.d: "The Arteshtaran have seen their influence increase in [Root.Country.GetName]. The machinations of a well-connected aristocracy, a strong sense of kin identity, and a growing reputation as indomitable warriors have all contributed to their rising power.

 rajputs_estate_events.4.t: "Marriage Alliances with the Arteshtaran"
 rajputs_estate_events.4.d: "Kinship is of paramount importance to the Arteshtaran clans, and as such there is no better way to cement their loyalty than by forging marriage alliances. Several of the most powerful Arteshtaran grandees have offered to wed their daughters into our line in exchange for a guarantee that they will continue to hold their ancestral lands and titles. Though some among the Arteshtaran leaders consider this an unacceptable act of sublimation, those that have offered marriage ties do so with plans to advance their position at court."
 rajputs_estate_events.5.t: "Arteshtaran Scion Seeks New Territory"
 rajputs_estate_events.5.d: "Arteshtaran power in the Middle East is predicated on centuries of conquest, colonization, and settlement of lands beyond their power base in Persia. A particularly bold and ambitious scion of a notable clan has appeared at court on a quest to enhance the prestige of his kin. Approaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he asks permission to settle [rajput_scion_province.GetName], where he shall found a new town. He promises in exchange to accept the rule of the [Root.Country.GetName] state and to raise an army in our support whenever it is needed."
 rajputs_estate_events.6.t: "The Arteshtaran Make Demands"
 rajputs_estate_events.6.d: "Arteshtaran nobles have come to both outnumber and outrank all other nobility at the [Root.GetAdjective] court. They know well the power they wield over our armies and our administration, and have leveraged this power to demand extreme concessions to Arteshtaran nobles and their territories. Our attempts to curb their power through subtle means have had little effect, and so we must consider taking drastic action; either we must accept that the Arteshtaran are a law unto themselves, or we must strip them of their noble ranks to restore balance to the court."
 rajputs_estate_events.7.t: "Integration of Arteshtaran Nobility"
 rajputs_estate_events.7.d: "Arteshtaran nobles are a common sight at the court of [Root.Country.GetName], though it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between them and the other courtiers that make their home in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The Arteshtaran at court have been thoroughly integrating into [Root.GetAdjective] aristocratic society, going so far as to learn the [Root.Culture.GetName] language, observe [Root.GetAdjective] courtly etiquette, and personally accompany the [Root.Monarch.GetName] wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. This is leading to the loss of a distinctly Arteshtaran voice at court, as these nobles have become more concerned with their personal advancement than in the interests of the Arteshtaran community."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.t: "The Arteshtaran Rebellion"
 rajputs_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between [Root.Country.GetName] and the Arteshtaran clans could hardly be worse. The marginalization of Arteshtaran nobles and the neglect of Arteshtaran soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. Though it has become traditional for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to formally appoint Arteshtaran clan leaders, in the current state of crisis our preferred candidate has been unanimously rejected by his would-be subjects. The Arteshtaran of [Root.Country.GetName] now demand the right to appoint their own leadership, and to be left to govern their own affairs in provinces they control. They are prepared to install their chosen leader by force if we insist on maintaining our chokehold on dynastic politics."
 rajputs_estate_events.9.t: "Arteshtaran Daena"
 rajputs_estate_events.9.d: "The cornerstone of Arteshtaran identity is their Daena, which they derive from the moral guidance in their bardic writings. Every Arteshtaran leader must put kinship above all else, surrounding himself with a brotherhood of warriors and advisors all sharing descent from a patrilineal ancestor. Arteshtaran soldiers must fight and die in service to their masters; nothing but absolute loyalty is acceptable.\n\nRather than attempting to suppress these traditional Arteshtaran values and power structures, [Root.Country.GetName] has encouraged them, harmonizing them with service to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The Arteshtaran see no contradiction between their Daena and their duty to us."
 rajputs_estate_events.11.t: "The Arteshtaran Aristocratic Diaspora"
 rajputs_estate_events.11.d: "Arteshtaran nobility has spread far and wide throughout the centuries, but a strong sense of kinship identity creates a common aristocratic culture. Arteshtaran chiefs know their status and history in relation to other Arteshtaran going back many generations.\n\nOur advisors, among them many Arteshtaran, suggest that these bonds could be exploited to the benefit of [Root.Country.GetName]. Most obviously, the Arteshtaran chiefs loyal to us could act as ambassadors to the Arteshtaran of nearby nations, enhancing our reputation in foreign courts. A more cunning option would be to exploit ancient grudges among the Arteshtaran as a means to claim foreign territory."

In recent months a decline in available mounts and a consequent rise in prices has made this a financially daunting prospect.

 marathas_estate_events.5.t: "Militarization of the Wuzurgan"
 marathas_estate_events.5.d: "The Wuzurgan bring with them a hardened martial culture to the lands they rule. They maintain close ties with the peasantry and lower castes, favoring an egalitarian outlook over a belief in the inherent worth of nobility. Unlike many Persian armies, which typically draw their manpower from the ranks of the nobility, the Wuzurgan raise legions of peasant-soldiers skilled in guerrilla warfare. Though unendowed with the excellence of noble and illustrious birth, their martial experience makes them superior to the easy and effeminate troops of our enemies."
 marathas_estate_events.6.d: "The increasing militarization of the Wuzurgan has ecological drawbacks. Where the peasantry once tended the fields, they now stand to gain easy riches by serving half the year as soldiers. Labor shortages plus an increasing demand for warhorses are making traditional agriculture difficult and unprofitable, making the land more vulnerable to famines. Many are turning towards pastoralism; cattle can be herded with a smaller labor force, can be driven into forests during a drought, or hidden in ravines in times of war.

They wear symbolic red dresses, believe in reincarnation and promote the concept of free love, but still sharing many Zoroastrian principles.\n\nSome among the Asronan see these heretical spiritual movements as a threat to their religious authority.
