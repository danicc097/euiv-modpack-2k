 #Descriptions
 pre_nomad_cavalry0DESCR: "The Kipchaks, or Cumans, managed to carve out a state across the entire Eastern Steppe through their highly mobile horseback warriors."
 pre_nomad_cavalry1DESCR: "One of the most significant military developments in medieval history, the horse-archer was the backbone of the Mongol Empire. Expertly-trained troops could tear even the strongest enemy armies to pieces by charging through their lines simultaneous with a flurry of arrows."
 pre_nomad_infantry0DESCR: "Though the Kipchaks, as with all steppe powers, were known for their use of horses, they needed to maintain skilled infantry archers to hold their position against more organized western powers."
 pre_nomad_infantry1DESCR: "As skilled as Mongol horse-archers are, a confined mass of traditional archers can wreak even more havoc on a clumped-up enemy formation."
 post_nomad_infantryDESCR: "Just as the Ottomans were supplied by their German allies with automatic weapons beyond their own technological capabilities, so too can the powers further east benefit from Western weapons dealers."
 post_nomad_cavalryDESCR: "The innovation of the Uhlan was to supply its rider with both sabers and firearms. As firearms have become more accurate and powerful, the nature of the Uhlan should be augmented with contemporary rifles."
 pre_tribal_cavalry0DESCR: "Komants proved that the Yotvingian cavalry tradition is able to stand up to more organized powers."
 pre_tribal_cavalry1DESCR: "The key to the success of a tribal state is its ability to raid. Faster horses with better-trained riders make for more effective raiding parties."
 pre_tribal_infantry0DESCR: "It is no accident that Samogitia was the last area of Europe to remain pagan, surviving all the way up to the 1400s. Their martial traditions were unprecedented among the already warlike Baltic tribes."
 pre_tribal_infantry1DESCR: "Under such rulers as Mindaugas, Lithuania adopted more Westernized practices, even at times converting to Christianity or adopting Papal-bestowed titles like 'King'. The Lithuanian warrior uses the best tactics of his homeland and of the strange foreigners abroad."
 post_tribal_infantryDESCR: "Sabers have fallen by the wayside, it is time to move on to advanced repeating rifles to truly hold up against our rivals."
 post_tribal_cavalryDESCR: "Rather than organizing cavalry on a theme-like system of local defenses, the nation must have a central body under a strict military hierarchy."
 pre_western_infantry_0DESCR: "Descending from the ancient armies of Rome and the Franks, early medieval armies were comprised of peasants conscripted via their feudal ties and freemen with more professional equipment."
 pre_western_cavalry_0DESCR: "The rise of Chivalric code coincided with the development of the Western Knight - a horseback combatant with noble connections."
 pre_eastern_infantry_0DESCR: "The devastating losses brought on by the rise of Islam and hostile Western powers led the Byzantine Emperors to radically reform their military system, establishing administrative districts called 'Themes'. Each theme was linked to a defensive army."
 pre_eastern_cavalry_0DESCR: "Based on the ancient Turma cavalry units of the Roman Empire, in the medieval era the term came to include regiment-sized groups of troops in the East."
 pre_muslim_infantry_0DESCR: "In the early days of the Shia caliphate in Egypt, its troops were made up of Kutama Berbers. Though conflict with Western powers necessitated reform of the military, the notion of an ethnicity-based army unit remained popular."
 pre_muslim_cavalry_0DESCR: "Heavy-duty horse archers maintained by a largely Turkic ethnic fighting force. In coordination with light infantry, Mamluks were used by the Fatimid Caliphate to great success, despite the status of many troops as slaves."
 pre_ottoman_infantry_0DESCR: "Light infantry troops commonly utilized in the first stage of a battle. Their purpose was to shower the opposing troops with arrows, thereby lowering their morale before the main force attacked."
 pre_ottoman_cavalry_0DESCR: "Cavalry units specialized in ambush techniques. They would lie in wait for their enemies, attacking them by surprise and thereafter quickly retreat before the enemy had time to regroup."
 pre_western_infantry_1aDESCR: "The earlier counterpart of standard Western European peasant levies. Since it was dangerous to arm peasants en-masse due to the possibility of revolt, armies were comprised of both peasants and small bands of trained retainers."
 pre_western_infantry_1bDESCR: "The Pike was an extremely long spearlike weapon used by various European powers in the Middle Ages."
 pre_western_cavalry_1aDESCR: "Originating in Iberia to combat Moorish forces during the Reconquista, Jinetes were light horsemen armed with swords or javelins."
 pre_western_cavalry_1bDESCR: "Though they originated with Greeks in the Eastern Mediterranean, Turcopole horse-archers were brought to the West during the Crusades. Organizations such as the Knights Templar and even the Teutonic Order were known to make use of them."
 pre_eastern_infantry_1aDESCR: "Standard Byzantine military regiment, comparable to an ancient Roman Legion. Though the size of Allagia varied, they were an important organizational unit in the Empire's defense right up to the mid 14th century."
 pre_eastern_infantry_1bDESCR: "The Sparth was a type of axe originally popular among Danish armies in the early Medieval era. The axe spread to be used by many Eastern armies as well was the Gallowglass of Ireland and Scotland."
 pre_eastern_cavalry_1aDESCR: "The lighter counterpart to the Cataphract, used for raiding and quick offensive flanking attacks. Used extensively by the Komnenos emperors of Byzantium, its name is cognate with 'Corsair' due to their mutual relation to raiding."
 pre_eastern_cavalry_1bDESCR: "Heavy armored mounted troops called 'Kataphraktoi' originated in Iran but were quickly co-opted by the Byzantine Empire. Carrying lances and covered head-to-toe in scales, both horse and rider were a formidable sight in the Medieval East."
 pre_muslim_infantry_1aDESCR: "The armies of Saladin would be incomplete with only melee infantry. Muslim Archers were the bane of Christian armies across the entire front of the Crusades, from Antioch to Granada."
 pre_muslim_infantry_1bDESCR: "Legendary Ayyubid general Saladin learned from extensive warfare against Crusader states and developed a fearsome set of military tactics for the use of the Islamic world. His Levantine armies turned the tide against Christendom and brought the Outremer to ruin."
 pre_muslim_cavalry_1aDESCR: "Curved 'Saracen' blades were a staple in Islamic mounted armies long before the age of the Ottomans, though they were continually advancing in terms of tactics and technology."
 pre_muslim_cavalry_1bDESCR: "Horse-archers had allowed the Mongol Empire to effortlessly mow down opposition in all parts of the world. It is only natural that Islamic forces, which bore a large brunt of the Mongol onslaught, would develop skilled mounted bowmen."
 pre_ottoman_infantry_1DESCR: "Light infantry troops commonly utilized in the first stage of a battle. Their purpose was to harass the opposing troops, thereby lowering their morale before the main force attacked."
 pre_ottoman_cavalry_1DESCR: "Traditional steppe tactics with mounted archers and lancers continued to dominate the battlefields with settlement on Byzantine lands providing both more modern arms and the knowledge to make use of them."
 pre_western_infantry_2aDESCR: "The English or Welsh longbow was one of the most powerful weapons of the Middle Ages. Mass peasant longbow levies allowed English armies to wreak havoc on the slower French knights during the Hundred Years War, defining such engagements as the Battle of Crécy and the Battle of Agincourt."
 pre_western_infantry_2bDESCR: "The Swiss Confederacy developed upon Pike warfare to create Pike Squares in the interest of combatting imperialist foreign powers set on Swiss subjugation. Pike Squares involved a highly coordinated rank formation, but allowed for high mobility through combining multiple Square groups."
 pre_western_cavalry_2aDESCR: "Irish Light Cavalry which spread throughout Western Europe in the 1200s. The use of Hobby horses allowed massive maneuverability where more standard Knights would be stuck, making Hobelars popular amongst Anglo-Norman forces who had encountered them when trying to conquer Ireland."
 pre_western_cavalry_2bDESCR: "Outside of distinct areas such as England and Northern France, feudalism was more of an abstract ideal than an actual institution, with so-called feudal relationships being established on an ad-hoc basis. Regardless, the landed Knights of the High Middle Ages were incredibly important to warfare, with a Knight's horse often being one of his most prized possessions."
 pre_eastern_infantry_2aDESCR: "The term 'Allagion' stopped being used around the 1350s, but the presence of ordered battle regiments in the Byzantine Empire and beyond was a certainty, having adapted to the overwhelming Turkish threat."
 pre_eastern_infantry_2bDESCR: "Pikes were not only used by Westerners. Eastern armies from Poland to the Balkans also made extensive use of pole-type weapons in their military endeavors."
 pre_eastern_cavalry_2aDESCR: "With the historical decline of the Byzantine Empire, Eastern Europeans reinforced their own distinct traditions in both culture, religion, and military. Distinctively Eastern cavalry forces would soon give way to a class of Knights as the pinnacle of warfare."
 pre_eastern_cavalry_2bDESCR: "Newer technologies in metallurgy, as well as adaptation to the tactics of encroaching Muslim forces, necessitated the development of modernized Cataphracts."
 pre_muslim_infantry_2aDESCR: "Zenata Berbers were a tribal confederation who contributed significantly to Almohad warfare through their archery skills, seeing action in such battles as Alarcos."
 pre_muslim_infantry_2bDESCR: "The Atlas Mountains and the barren plains around them make the Maghreb home to a fierce class of infantry fighters who can withstand tough conditions for extended periods of time."
 pre_muslim_cavalry_2aDESCR: "Barb Horses derive their name from the Berber tribes, and were known throughout history for their hardiness."
 pre_muslim_cavalry_2bDESCR: "Combining the skill of Islamic horse-archers with the prowess of Barb horses allowed the Maghreb to display considerable resistance against various Christian invasions."
 pre_ottoman_infantry_2DESCR: "While the Yaya or Piyade mercenaries became more prominent towards the end of the 14th century, they were used by Turks as early as the 1320s when the vizier Alaeddin Pasha helped reorganize the Ottoman military."
 pre_ottoman_cavalry_2DESCR: "Akinji or Akinci were light cavalry units known for their fierce prowess under the command of the Ottoman Turks. Almost every historical stereotype about Eastern armies, from Winged uniforms to Horned helmets, were allegedly part of Akinji outfits in an attempt to shock and confuse hostile forces. As Turkish expansion waned, so too did this warrior class."
 advanced_howitzerDESCR: "Rifled artillery much larger than its predecessor Howitzer prototypes, extremely effective at damaging walls."
 post_western_infantry_aDESCR: "The Dreyse Needle-Gun was faster than contemporary rifles, allowing Prussian armies to dominate neighboring powers through mass production."
 post_western_infantry_bDESCR: "Invented by American gunsmith Richard Gatling in the 1860s, the Gatling Gun could fire near-continuously. Though it saw limited use in the Americas, it was replaced in Europe with the Maxim Gun."
 post_western_infantry_cDESCR: "Advanced version of the Napoleonic Square utilizing mobile formation and machine guns. The reformed square was powerful but less effective against contemporary firearms."
 post_western_cavalry_aDESCR: "With the end of the Napoleonic French Empire, chasseurs still saw extensive use from Western powers, existing as a separate corps from more standard unmounted infantry."
 post_western_cavalry_bDESCR: "During the mid 19th century, the need to modernize Dragoons was evident. Countries such as Great Britain turned their old Dragoons into newer units akin to Hussars or Lancers while maintaining the same general tactics."
 post_western_cavalry_cDESCR: "Lightweight but effective, the Sabre was a welcome substitute to more bulky weapons previously used by Western melee cavalry."
 post_eastern_infantryDESCR: "Russia's dedication to modernization, though marred by rocky defeats such as the Crimean War, made their infantry the pride of Eastern Europe."
 post_eastern_cavalry_aDESCR: "Having established their presence as a crucial military estate, teaching the Cossacks innovative Western tactics would allow them to become more formidable than ever, especially against weak Steppe neighbors."
 post_eastern_cavalry_bDESCR: "The effectiveness of Cuirassiers in the Napoleonic Wars reminded Eastern powers such as Russia of their value, reinvigorating their use on the battlefield, though Western powers like Austria and France started phasing them out entirely."
 post_muslim_infantryDESCR: "Though the Industrial Revolution gave Europeans a technological edge, it was possible for many Islamic states to co-opt and improve upon Western infantry unit formations and weapons."
 post_muslim_cavalry_aDESCR: "Repeating rifles turned the tides in late 19th century warfare, making them crucial for a successful mounted army."
 post_muslim_cavalry_bDESCR: "Muslim Dragoons fought on foot but rode on horseback. The introduction of new tactics would allow for more effective Dragoon warfare in response to various European innovations."
 post_ottoman_infantryDESCR: "With the Ottoman Empire lagging behind its neighbors in the 1800s, earning the moniker 'sick man of Europe', it was necessary to advance upon earlier attempts at Army modernization."
 post_ottoman_cavalry_aDESCR: "Abdul Hamid II, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, established these irregular cavalry units in the late 19th century inspired by Russian Cossacks."

 SAMURAI_DESC: "From the mid 13th century to the late 16th century, the Gallowglass formed an elite group of mercenary warriors who primarily hailed from the Norse-Gaelic clans of Ireland and Scotland. Originally referring to the Scots who shared linguistic and cultural ties with the Irish, the term later encompassed the descendants of 10th-century Norse settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland. The Gallowglass were highly sought after as heavily armored and trained infantry who could effectively defend a position, which set them apart from most Irish foot soldiers who lacked comparable armor to their noble cavalry counterparts.\nGallowglass can be recruited in owned provinces that belong to the §YIrish§!, §YNorse-Gaelic§!, §YCumbric§!, §YHighlander§! and §YManx§! cultures, and the number of Gallowglass that can be raised is dependent on the development of those provinces."
